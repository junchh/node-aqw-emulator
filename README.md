# node-aqw-emulator

This is an experimental game server for AQWorlds, a private server emulator created using Node.js.
since flash player support is already nonexistent on the web, this project is officially over, unless you somehow host the flash client elsewhere.

# Notice
I don't own any assets used in the client side of the project (all the rights belong to Artix Entertainment), so that will never be published. This project is purely for educational purposes only.
